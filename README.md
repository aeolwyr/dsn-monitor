DSN Monitor
===========
DSN Monitor is an unofficial app for NASA's
[DSN Now](https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn).  
It displays the status of the Deep Space Network communications
in real time, or it can show a previously saved state of the network.

What is DSN?
------------
The NASA Deep Space Network is a network of antennas located in the US, Spain
and Australia. It is used to communicate with the spacecrafts located in the
deep space. For more information, see the
[DSN homepage](https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/), or its
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network).

Features
--------
* **Real time detailed data** - See all the data provided by the NASA
Deep Space Network, including which spacecraft is sending data right now
or which one is receiving commands, which dish is used to do this
communication, what is the frequency or the data rate, etc.
* **History** - Never miss a _space_ moment with a history system, pin the
important ones to keep them forever.
* **Save/load** - Save the current state (the original data acquired from
NASA) to your internal storage, SD card or to any cloud storage
(requires the relevant cloud app to be installed).
* **Customization** - Switch between different units, including metric/imperial
for distances, or dBm/watts for power.
